# PARA-ATM Research Collection

(This is an example repository for demonstration purposes.)

This repository contains work conducted under the NASA ULI project "Information fusion for real-time national air transportation system prognostics under uncertainty", which is led by Arizona State University.  The repository directory structure is organized topic.  The individual contributions include code and data for examples and demonstration cases developed under the project, primarily written in the Python programming language.

Many of the contributions here also make use of the [para-atm](https://github.com/ymlasu/para-atm) and [GNATS](https://github.com/OptimalSynthesisInc/GNATS) software.  para-atm is a Python package that provides a suite of tools to support research and analysis of national airspace safety.  GNATS is a Generalized National Airspace Trajectory Prediction system.

For information about how to contribute, please see the [Guide for Contributing](https://github.com/jmcfarland-swri/ULI-example/wiki/Contributing).
